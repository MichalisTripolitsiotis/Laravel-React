# Laravel & React

My first Laravel and React project. It has all the main Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) functionalities. I also used Axios to make the needed requests. <br>
I used Laravel Sail as a development environment. <br>
There are some features that have to be completed such as:<br>

-   Some styling
-   Write test cases
