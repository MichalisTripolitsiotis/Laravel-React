# Laravel & React

My first Laravel and React project. It has all the main Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) functionalities. I also used Axios to make the needed requests.
You can dynamically mark a post as completed/uncompleted. I also made a search functionality that updates the table while you are typing either the title or the description.

I used Laravel Sail as a development environment. <br>
